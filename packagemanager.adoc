== Working with Package Managers & Repositories

When working with Nashorn, you probably don't want to develop every function from scratch.
There are already libraries which provide the functionalities you need.
Just like using a dependency lib from Maven, you can use libraries with Nashorn.
And more than that, you can choose out of various repositories and package managers,
as there is Java, JavaScript and the perfect symbiosis of both.

=== NPM

**N**ode **P**ackage **M**anager - https://npmjs.org

- NPM is the _package manager_ of choice when working with JavaScript only, no matter if for browser only or also server-side with Node.js.
- The _NPM registry_ is a public collection of packages of open-source code.
- NPM is also a _command line client_.

You can use packages from NPM within Nashorn! _But_...


==== JVM-NPM

Most/many packages rely on http://www.commonjs.org/[CommonJS] with the `require()` syntax (kind like an `import` in Java).
As Nashorn is just a JavaScript engine, it unfortunately doesn't have support for a package manager and/or a dependency loading mechanism.

Luckily there is a project called https://github.com/nodyn/jvm-npm[npm-jvm] (a _NPM compliant CommonJS module loader for the JVM_),
which brings the `require()` function to Nashorn. So it becomes possible to use packages which rely on CommonJS in Nashorn
and also load other modules by using the `require()` function into your Nashorn script context.

===== Usage

Using the global `load()` function supplied by Nashorn to load `jvm-npm.js` into the global execution context.
Then it's possible to load any module with `require()`:

[source]
----
nashorn> load('./jvm-npm.js');
nashorn> var x = require('some_module');
----


[small]#Alternatively there's also a project called https://github.com/walterhiggins/commonjs-modules-javax-script[commonjs-modules-javax-script] which should do similar things.#


==== Polyfill.js

Many libraries registered in NPM, make use of the Node.js and/or the common browser APIs.
As Nashorn isn't Node.js nor a browser, we have to add some glue to make it work.
This glue is called _polyfill_, to provide functions to an environment, where these functions aren't available by default.

For most use cases, this `nashorn-polyfill.js` polyfill should work:

[source,javascript]
.nashorn-polyfill.js
----
var global = this;<1>
var window = this;<2>
var process = {env:{}};<3>

var console = {};<4>
console.debug = print;
console.log = print;
console.warn = print;
console.error = print;
----
<1> Node.js has a `global` variable, which we have to provide - it's just the global context.
<2> Browsers have a `window` variable, referring the global context, we have to provide it also.
<3> Some packages make use of the `process.env` object of Node.js, as this is also not available, we just provide an empty object.
<4> Nashorn doesn't have a `console` and arbitrary `log` statements, so we assign the `print` function to the most used/common console output functions.


==== Native API access

Nashorn doesn't have access to native language (C/C++) APIs. NPM packages using native APIs can't be used in Nashorn.

NOTE: There are discussions out in the wild, if it is possible to use http://www.jython.org[Jython] to run Python-based NPM packages inside the JVM,
but I donâ€™t know of any approach/project testing this.


=== Maven

When using Nashorn within a Java project, it's obvious to use Maven as repository and package manager.
This is possible without problems, but with a few plugins and helpers!

==== Maven and NPM, Grunt, Gulp, etc.

If you don't want to work without the Node.js ecosystem, NPM and frontend build tools like Grunt, Gulp and Webpack,
there's a handy Maven plugin, which solves all your problems:

https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin/

Please refer to the GitHub page to get a detailed description and documentation of this plugin!

==== WebJars

Many of the most popular and most used NPM packages are provided as http://www.webjars.org/[WebJars].
With WebJars, you can use NPM packages just as regular Maven dependencies in your project.

Example for using http://momentjs.com/[Moment.js] as Maven dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.webjars.npm</groupId>
    <artifactId>moment</artifactId>
    <version>2.11.2</version>
</dependency>
----

If there is no WebJar of your favourite NPM package available, it's easy to create one.
There's a http://www.webjars.org/contributing[detailed documentation on the website], on how to do it.


==== Nasven

https://github.com/nasven/nasven[Nasven.js] is a server, desktop, and shell-script application runtime for apps written in Javascript possibly dependent on Maven artifacts.

Nasven = Nashorn + Maven. A tool to get Maven artifacts in scope for Nashorn script execution.

[source,bash]

NOTE: Nearly everything that I wrote about Maven is somehow available in similar ways/plugins for e.g. Gradle or any other popular build system. Just have a look around in the proper ecosystem!
