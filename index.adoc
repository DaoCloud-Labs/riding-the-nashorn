= Riding the Nashorn
Niko KÃ¶bler <niko@n-k.de, http://www.n-k.de, https://twitter.com/dasniko[@dasniko]>

Nashorn is the official JavaScript Engine in the Java Virtual Machine since Version 8.
It supports and implements the ECMAScript 5.1 specification and competes among others directly with https://developers.google.com/v8/[Google V8] (the script enginge behind https://nodejs.org[Node.js]).
Nashorn compiles JavaScript to Java Bytecode during runtime and thus provides high interoperability of Java and JavaScript.

In this script I want to dig into some of the (IMO) most used options, functions, features, and use-cases.
After working through this tutorial you'll be able to use Nashorn and its dynamic scripting features in your daily Java business.

_Another good starting point for Nashorn resources might be the http://openjdk.java.net/projects/nashorn/[Official Project Nashorn Website] with links to the mailing-list, the blog and the wiki pages. Check it out!_
